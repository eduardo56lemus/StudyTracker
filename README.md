# Study Tracker - Actuarial Exam Preparation

## Purpose

The **Study Tracker** is an application I created to help track the time I need to study for my **actuarial exam**. This tool allows me to input the total number of hours I need to study, the day of the exam, the number of days remaining, and how many hours I have already studied. It then provides real-time progress updates, helping me stay on track and manage my study time effectively.

### Key Features:
- **Input total study hours**
- **Track progress by entering hours studied**
- **Calculate the remaining time to study**
- **Provide progress updates based on time left and hours studied**

## Tools Used

- **Java**: The programming language I used to develop the application.
- **NetBeans**: The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) I used to build the project, which includes features like GUI design and project management.
- **Swing**: Javaâ€™s GUI toolkit, used for creating the user interface of the Study Tracker.

## Steps Taken

1. **Initial Planning**: I began by determining the core functionality needed to track study hours and progress.
2. **Design**: I created a basic layout for the GUI, including input fields for total study hours, hours studied, remaining days, and the exam date.
3. **Implementation**: I wrote the logic to calculate the remaining hours and study time based on my input, and set up real-time progress tracking features.
4. **Testing**: I tested the application to ensure the calculations were correct and the user experience was smooth.
5. **Commit to GitHub**: After finishing the project, I uploaded the source code and project files to GitHub for version control and sharing.

## Future Improvements

- **Dark Mode/Custom Background**: I plan to add the ability to switch between light and dark modes for better user experience.
- **Advanced Features**: 
  - I would like to add the option to track different study topics and allocate hours based on topic importance.
  - Adding reminders and notifications for daily study goals is another feature I aim to implement.

## How to Run

1. Download the project files.
2. Open the project in **NetBeans**.
3. Run the program to begin tracking study hours.
